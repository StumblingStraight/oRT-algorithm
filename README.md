## Introduction
This repository contains MATLAB code for online Reaction Time (oRT) algorithm testing. In brief, this project used XY data of upper extremity reaching movements in 17 human subjects and generated grand-mean acceleration profiles of the reaching movements with an identified oRT. Noise trials were then added to these traces to generate hybrid trials. Several different oRT-identification algorithms are then tested against these hybrid trials that now contain known oRTs and a set amount of noise.

## Installation
Download this repository into a folder on your computer and run the files with MATLAB (Mathworks, Natick, MA). Note that this code was written for use in MATLAB R2020a, and may not work for future versions.

## Usage
